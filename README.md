User Story

As a traveler, I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that I can plan a trip accordingly.

Acceptance Criteria

Given a weather dashboard with form inputs, when I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history.
When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
When I click on a city in the search history, then I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
